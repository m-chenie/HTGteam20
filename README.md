Medical terms are not common sense.
Limited medical literacy is not only stunting access to physical & mental healthcare as a whole, but also putting lives at risk.
The main victims of low health literacy include:
- immigrants, especially those who have English as their second language
- low economic background limits people's access to resources/schooling that would allow them to gain medical literacy
- Older adults are also unfamiliar with new medical terms and digital forms

Meet our solution Medi+Form.
Medi+Form is a Chrome extension that saves, autofills, and translates medical jargon to basic English.
It can also read out the medical jargon terms along with their lay definitions.

To use Medi+Form, download all the files in the repository and store them in one file.
